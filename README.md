# CarpetCostEstimator
In this question you will write a class called CarpetCostEstimator which models a cost estimator for a carpet shop supplying and fitting carpet. The class has 3 instance variables:
•	price, the price of the carpet in £ per square metre as a double,
•	labourCharge, the labour charge in £ per square metre as a double,
•	postCode, the customer’s postcode as a String (used to determine a price multiplier for expensive areas).
You will write methods to calculate and display the cost of fitting a carpet, given its width and length and the customer’s postcode.
